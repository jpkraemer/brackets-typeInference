# Type Inference

Type inference is a Brackets plugin that tries to bring type information back to Javascript. It leverages runtime information as well as static analysis to determine the types of function arguments. This information is used to automatically keep documentation up to date, warn about inconsistencies and to improve Bracket's autocompletion.
